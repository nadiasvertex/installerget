This is a native-code project intended to be useful for installers that need to download files during the installation process.

wget and curl are great, but they require an ugly and possibly confusing console window to be up in order to display their progress.

This tool can get anything curl can get, but displays progress in a small, attractive window that can be customized on the command-line.
